# Tesla Stock Price Forecasting: LSTM vs RNN Analysis

This notebook implements and compares two popular time series forecasting models (LSTM and RNN) for predicting Tesla stock prices. Below is a detailed explanation of each component.

## 1. Libraries and Dependencies

The code begins by importing necessary libraries:

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **pandas & numpy** | Data manipulation and numerical operations |
| **seaborn & matplotlib** | Data visualization |
| **sklearn** | Data preprocessing, model evaluation, and train-test splitting |
| **tensorflow.keras** | Building and training deep learning models |
| **time** | Measuring model training time |

## 2. Data Preparation Functions

### Data Loading

```python
def load_data(file_path):
```

This function:
- Loads Tesla stock data from CSV
- Removes the first two rows (likely header information)
- Converts data columns to float
- Properly formats the date column and sets it as index

### Feature Engineering

Two key feature engineering functions:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `calculate_pct_change()` | Calculates daily percentage change in closing price |
| `calculate_moving_average()` | Implements a simple moving average over n days |

### Sequence Creation

```python
def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
```

This is crucial for time series modeling:
- Creates sliding window sequences of length `seq_length`
- Each sequence becomes an input (X)
- The next time step becomes the target (y)
- Returns numpy arrays ready for model training

## 3. Model Architecture

The code implements two neural network architectures:

### LSTM Model

```python
def build_lstm_model(input_shape, units=100):
```

Long Short-Term Memory networks are specialized RNNs designed to learn long-term dependencies:
- Input layer accepting the sequence data shape
- LSTM layer with specified units
- Dropout (0.2) to prevent overfitting
- Dense output layer

### RNN Model 

```python
def build_rnn_model(input_shape, units=100):
```

Simple/Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network:
- Mirrors the LSTM architecture for fair comparison
- Uses SimpleRNN layer instead of LSTM
- Same dropout rate and dense output layer

## 4. Forecasting Function

```python
def forecast_future(model, last_sequence, scaler, days_to_predict, seq_length, feature_count, start_date):
```

This implements recursive forecasting:
- Takes the last known sequence of data
- Makes a prediction for the next time step
- Incorporates that prediction into the input window
- Repeats for the specified number of days
- Returns a DataFrame with date index and forecasted values

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

```python
def calculate_metrics(y_true, y_pred):
```

Comprehensive model evaluation using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- RÂ² Score
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

## 6. Visualization Functions

The code includes multiple visualization functions:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `plot_percentage_change()` | Visualizes daily price changes and their distribution |
| `plot_stock_with_ma()` | Shows stock price with moving average and volume |
| `plot_model_comparison()` | Compares LSTM and RNN predictions against actual prices |
| `plot_error_comparison()` | Analyzes prediction errors for both models |
| `plot_close_predictions_detail()` | Detailed view of recent predictions |
| `plot_forecast_comparison()` | Compares future forecasts from both models |
| `plot_training_history()` | Visualizes training and validation loss curves |
| `plot_volatility_analysis()` | Examines price volatility over time |
| `plot_candlestick_chart()` | Traditional financial chart showing OHLC data |
| `compare_model_metrics()` | Side-by-side comparison of performance metrics |

## 7. Main Execution Flow

The `main()` function orchestrates the entire process:

1. **Configuration**:
   - Sets parameters like sequence length, units, batch size, epochs
   - Defines forecast horizon (30 days)
   - Sets train/test/validation split ratios

2. **Data Processing**: 
   - Loads and explores the dataset
   - Visualizes initial data characteristics
   - Scales data using MinMaxScaler
   - Creates input sequences

3. **Model Training**:
   - Builds LSTM and RNN models
   - Trains both models with validation
   - Measures and compares training times
   - Visualizes training history

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Makes predictions on test data
   - Calculates performance metrics
   - Visualizes prediction accuracy

5. **Forecasting**:
   - Generates 30-day forecasts using both models
   - Visualizes and compares forecasts
   - Calculates percentage changes from last known price

6. **Summary**:
   - Comprehensive comparison of model performance
   - Determines which model performed better by different metrics

## 8. Key Insights and Improvements

- The model uses a sequence length of 120 days to predict the next day
- The final layer outputs all features (open, high, low, close, volume)
- The forecasting method recursively predicts multiple steps ahead
- GPU acceleration is used when available
- Both models are compared in terms of:
  - Training time
  - Prediction accuracy
  - Validation loss
  - Forecast divergence

## 9. Potential Enhancements

The code could be improved by:
- Adding feature engineering for technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Implementing attention mechanisms to improve LSTM performance
- Adding transformer-based models for comparison
- Incorporating external factors (market indices, news sentiment)
- Implementing ensemble methods to combine predictions
- Adding hyperparameter tuning
- Implementing early stopping to prevent overfitting
